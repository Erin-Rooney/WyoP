Core Ideas
1. The combination of compost and cover crops resulted in increased available P.
2. Compost amendment in fallow soil decreased acid phosphatase activity for the first four weeks of the incubation.
3. Cover crop biomass showed a direct correlation with subsequent wheat biomass.
4. Lower biomass cover crops that increase P availability may perform well in low-moisture field conditions.
Key words: phosphorus fractionation, semi-arid, calcareous soil, compost, cover crops
